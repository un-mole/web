            Indore is the largest and the most populous city of Madhya Pradesh. Located on the Malwa Plateau, the charm of this city lies in its rich cultural heritage which has been preserved over centuries and along with the hints of urbanisation.

Indore has been one of the fore-runners in the development of the country in the era of modernization. One of the educational hubs in the country, Indore has both an IIT and an IIM. Indore is also the cleanest city of India. Indore has over the years established itself as the hub of trading and industrial practices in the state.  The city of Indore gets its name from Indreshwar Mahadev temple. It is believed that Lord Indra meditated on this land and led Swami Indrapuri to establish this temple.
